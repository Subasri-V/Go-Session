// Question 1: Which of the following code snippets correctly demonstrates the if statement in Go?

// Options:

// a. if x > 5 {
//      fmt.Println("x is greater than 5")
// }

// b. for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
//      if i%2 == 0 {
//          fmt.Println(i)
//      }
// }

// c. switch num {
//      case 1:
//          fmt.Println("One")
//      case 2:
//          fmt.Println("Two")
//      default:
//          fmt.Println("Other")
// }

// d. var result int
// if result {
//      fmt.Println("Result is true")
// }
// Answer: a. if x > 5 { fmt.Println("x is greater than 5") }

// Question 2: In Go, how is the switch statement used for control flow, and what is a valid syntax for it?

// Options:

// a. The `switch` statement is used for loops, and a valid syntax includes `switch`, `condition`, and `break` statements.

// b. The `switch` statement is used for conditional branching, and a valid syntax includes `switch`, `case`, and `default` clauses.

// c. The `switch` statement is used for defining functions, and a valid syntax includes `switch`, `func`, and `return` statements.

// d. The `switch` statement is used for declaring variables, and a valid syntax includes `switch`, `var`, and `name` declarations.
// Answer: b. The switch statement is used for conditional branching, and a valid syntax includes switch, case, and default clauses.

// Question 3: Which statement can be used to exit a loop prematurely in Go?

// Options:

// a. `return`

// b. `break`

// c. `continue`

// d. `exit`
// Answer: b. break

// Question 4: What is the purpose of the for loop in Go, and how can it be used to iterate over elements of a slice?

// Options:

// a. The `for` loop is used for defining functions, and it cannot be used to iterate over slices.

// b. The `for` loop is used for conditional branching, and it can be used to iterate over slices by specifying a condition.

// c. The `for` loop is used for iteration, and it can be used to iterate over slices by using the `range` keyword.

// d. The `for` loop is used for error handling, and it can be used to iterate over slices by using `try` and `catch` blocks.
// Answer: c. The for loop is used for iteration, and it can be used to iterate over slices by using the range keyword.

// Question 5: What is the purpose of the break and continue statements in Go?

// Options:

// a. The `break` statement is used to exit a loop prematurely, and the `continue` statement is used to end the program.

// b. The `break` statement is used to continue to the next iteration of a loop, and the `continue` statement is used to exit the program.

// c. The `break` statement is used to exit a loop prematurely, and the `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration and proceed to the next.

// d. The `break` statement is used to create a loop, and the `continue` statement is used to pause the program.
// Answer: c. The break statement is used to exit a loop prematurely, and the continue statement is used to skip the current iteration and proceed to the next.

// Question 6: What is the purpose of a labeled statement in Go, and how is it used?

// Options:

// a. A labeled statement is used to define custom data types in Go, and it is declared with the `type` keyword.

// b. A labeled statement is used to assign labels to variables, and it is declared with the `label` keyword.

// c. A labeled statement is used to create named blocks of code that can be the target of `break` and `continue` statements, and it is declared before a block of code.

// d. A labeled statement is used to indicate the end of a function in Go, and it is declared with the `end` keyword.
// Answer: c. A labeled statement is used to create named blocks of code that can be the target of break and continue statements, and it is declared before a block of code.
